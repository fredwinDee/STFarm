    <h2>Sleepy Orchard</h2>
    <p>This is a clever name used to disguise a big mistake in selecting the rootstock when we planted the first
        apple trees. The first varieties were planted on interstem stock intended for trellis support structures used in
        the Northwest. Consequently
        they laid down to take a nap when they got older, hence the name.
        The trees planted in the next section of the orchard used a typical M26 dwarfing rootstock and they stand up by
        themselves. </p>
