    <h2>What we grow</h2>
    <p>Edible landscaping is used to a significant extent, incorporating Blackberry, Grape, Kiwi, Goji berry, Paw paw,
        etc. as
        well as native fruits and nuts in the botanical gardens and surrounding landscape.</p>
    <p>We also cultivate a more traditional food garden, again with stone terraced raised beds where we grow a more
        typical mix of vegetables and fruits with some companion flowers and herbs mixed in.</p>

    <p>Herbs also have their own small garden, closest to the kitchen.</p>

    <p>Fall 2021: We have started a special project. <a href="#specialprojects"> Check it out!</a></p>

        <h2>Special Projects</h2>
        <p>We are starting a small pilot project in partnership with Growing Hope Gobally (GHG). The high level concept
            is we
            grow some product here in our gardens that can be marketed to convert it to cash which is then donated to
            GHG which partners with local organizations in the developing world to support sustainable
            solutions to hunger.
            Read more about <a href="https://www.growinghopeglobally.org/"> Growing Hope Globally here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Since in the developed world we will happily pay more money for flowers than food because we take our
            inexpensive
            food supply for granted,
            the pilot project will grow flowers to sell to provide money for resources to people who need to grow food.
        </p>
        <p>Fall of 2021 we will plant 600 late flowering Tulips that can be marketed at area events in May 2022, and
            then in Spring 2022,
            we will plant 1000 Gladiolus in several staggered plantings for marketing at events from July through
            September 2022.</p>
        <p>Our goal is to produce at least $1000 net profit to donate to GHG, with 25% going to a local food pantry.
            Thinking and acting locally and globally.
