    <h2>What we grow</h2>
    <p>Edible landscaping is used to a significant extent, incorporating Blackberry, Grape, Kiwi, Goji berry, Paw paw,
        etc. as
        well as native fruits and nuts in the botanical gardens and surrounding landscape.</p>
    <p>We also cultivate a more traditional food garden, again with stone terraced raised beds where we grow a more
        typical mix of vegetables and fruits with some companion flowers and herbs mixed in.</p>
    <p>Herbs also have their own small garden, closest to the kitchen.</p>
