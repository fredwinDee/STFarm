    <h2>Special Projects</h2>
    <p>Fall 2021:</p>
    <p>We have started a small pilot project in partnership with Growing Hope Gobally (GHG). The high level
        concept is we
        grow some product here in our gardens that can be marketed to convert it to cash which is then donated to
        GHG which partners with local organizations in the developing world to support sustainable
        solutions to hunger.
        Read more about GHG here <a href="https://www.growinghopeglobally.org/"> Growing Hope Globally</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Since in the developed world we will happily pay more money for flowers than food because we take our
        inexpensive
        food supply for granted,
        the pilot project will grow flowers to sell to provide money for resources to people who need to grow food.
    </p>
    <p>Fall of 2021 we planted 900 late flowering Tulips that can be marketed at area events in May 2022, and
        then in Spring 2022,
        we will plant 1000 Gladiolus in several staggered plantings for marketing at events from July through
        September 2022.</p>
    <p>Our goal is to produce at least $1000 net profit to donate to GHG, with 25% going to a local food pantry
        <a href="https://https://ccfoodsunday.org//"> Carroll County Food Sunday</a> (CCFS).
        Thinking and acting locally and globally.

    <p>Fall 2022 Update:</p>
    <p>We learned a great deal about both the production aspects and marketing and sales challenges of our project and
        had
        modest success in executing our plan, netting about $500
        in profit for our target charities, half of our original goal.
        After much discussion we also decided to split the proceeds evenly between GHG and CCFS to make our sales
        efforts more appealing
        locally.
