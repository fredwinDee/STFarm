    <h2>Special Projects</h2>
    <p>Fall 2021: We have started a small pilot project in partnership with Growing Hope Gobally (GHG). The high level
        concept is we
        grow some product here in our gardens that can be marketed to convert it to cash which is then donated to
        GHG which partners with local organizations in the developing world to support sustainable
        solutions to hunger.

    </p>
    <p>Since in the developed world we will happily pay more money for flowers than food because we take our
        inexpensive
        food supply for granted,
        the pilot project will grow flowers to sell to provide money for resources to people who need to grow food.
    </p>
    <p>Fall of 2021 we planted 900 late flowering Tulips that can be marketed at area events in May 2022, and
        then in Spring 2022,
        we will plant 1000 Gladiolus in several staggered plantings for marketing at events from July through
        September 2022.</p>
    <p>Our goal is to produce at least $1000 net profit to donate to GHG, with 25% going to a local food pantry.
        Thinking and acting locally and globally.
