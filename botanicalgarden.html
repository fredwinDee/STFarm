    <h2>Botanical gardens</h2>
    <p>The botanical gardens at the farm intend to combine beauty and function, utilizing native and non-native
        species of annuals, perennials, flowering shrubs, and trees to provide a wide variety of food sources
        and habitats for all manner of living things.</p>
    <p>This ethic means we allow clover to grow in the lawn areas to provide early forage for native bees,
        and although we don't promote dandelions, neither do we aggressively remove them and even occasionally eat them
        in
        early Spring, after all, that is why the colonists brought them from Europe.
        You will find Queen Anne's lace everywhere as well as milkweed and many other "weeds" that native bees and flies
        and other small pollinators need, as well as classic attractants such as Spirea and Viburnam.
    </p>
    <p>Depending on how one counts, there are about 15 small to large beds and borders that currently comprise the
        botanical
        gardens.
        An incomplete list of species can be found <a href="">here</a>.
