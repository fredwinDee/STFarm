    <h2>Family Forest</h2>
    <p>The approximately 16 acres of wooded hillside on both sides of the valley on the Eastern part of the property
        are a designated Family Forest, previously known as a Tree Farm.</p>
    <p>A small stream runs through the forest at about 80' in elevation below the homestead.
        This is a tributary of the West Branch of the Patapsco River so our small forest provides a much needed riparian
        buffer to this important feeder stream.
    </p>
    <p>There are always a number of projects going on in our small forest such as path creation and maintenance,
        invasives removal, and thinning.
    </p>

    <h3>Burn piles and brush piles</h3>
    <p>For years we collected tree debris from storms, pruning, general slash from woodland management, etc. in a
        huge pile in the lower field and burned it each year in late winter. This approach was what one of us grew up
        with in central Maine.
        Great fun, but we realized this was not the most ecological approach in general and certainly not one for a
        warming
        world.</p>
    <p>After taking the <a
            href="https://extension.umd.edu/programs/environment-natural-resources/program-areas/general-forestry-course">
            General Forestry Course</a> through the University of Maryland Extension (highly recommended) and
        encountering an actual
        manual for where and how to build a brush pile to foster wildlife, we switched to accumulating our
        slash into (currently) two main brush piles on the borders of the pollinator meadow.</p>

        <p> Not surprisingly, they look very similar.
            They were created about a year apart and are added to regualrly with no particular pattern.
            The base is a number of larger logs and limbs stacked crossiwise like a log cabin which provides
            plenty of crawl spaces and hiding for small mammals, then larger brush is piled on top creating a mostly
            waterproof cover. The whole gradual decay process provides hbitat for all the creatures below mammals and
            birds in the food chain: bugs, worms, mushrooms, bacteria, you name it. </p>

    <h3 id="Checkdams">Check dams</h3>
    <div>
        <p>One of the significant ongoing current projects is an effort to construct check dams along the
            old logging roads created when the area was cut over about 60 years ago.

    <h3 id="Plantingtrees"> Planting trees</h3>
    <p>
        We have planted Sycamore trees in the small floodplain along the stream.
    </p>
    <p>This is the view after clearing out various invasives such as <a
            href="https://www.invasive.org/eastern/midatlantic/romu.html">Multiflora Rose</a> , <a
            href="https://www.invasive.org/alien/pubs/midatlantic/beth.htm">Japanese Barberry</a>, and
        <a href="https://www.invasive.org/alien/pubs/midatlantic/ceor.htm">Oriental
            Bittersweet</a>.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>The Sycamores are planted in 5' tree shelters. These provide an advantageous greenhouse
        atmosphere for growth in the first 3-5 years and protects them from browsing by White-tailed deer.</p>
