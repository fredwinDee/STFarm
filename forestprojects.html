    <h2>Forest Projects</h2>
    <p>The approximately 16 acres of wooded hillside on both sides of a valley
        are a designated Family Forest, previously known as a Tree Farm.</p>
    <p>A small stream runs through the forest at about 80' in elevation below the farmhouse.
        This is a tributary to the West Branch of the Patapsco River so our small forest provides a much needed riparian
        buffer to this important feeder stream.

    <div>
        <p>One of the significant current projects is an effort to construct check dams along the
            old logging roads created when the area was cut over about 60 years ago.

    <p>
        We have planted Sycamore trees in the small floodplain along the stream.

    <p>This is the view after clearing out various invasives such as <a

            href="https://www.invasive.org/alien/pubs/midatlantic/beth.htm">Japanese Barberry</a>, and Oriental
        Bittersweet. </p>

    <p>The Sycamores are planted in 5' tree shelters. These provide an advantageous greenhouse
        atmosphere for growth in the first 3-5 years and protects them from browsing by White-tailed deer.</p>
