    <h2>Family Forest</h2>
    <p>The approximately 16 acres of wooded hillside on both sides of the valley on the Eastern part of the property
        are a designated Family Forest, previously known as a Tree Farm.</p>
    <p>A small stream runs through the forest at about 80' in elevation below the homestead.
        This is a tributary of the West Branch of the Patapsco River so our small forest provides a much needed riparian
        buffer to this important feeder stream.
    </p>
    <p>There are always a number of projects going on in our small forest such as path creation and maintenance,
        invasives removal, and thinning.
    </p>

    <p>Some specific project details:</p>

    <h3>Burn piles and brush piles</h3>
    <p>For years we collected tree debris from storms, pruning, general slash from woodland management, etc. in a
        huge pile in the lower field and burned it each year in late winter. This approach was what one of us grew up
        with in central Maine.
        Great fun, but we realized this was not the most ecological approach in general and certainly not one for a
        warming
        world.</p>
    <p>After taking the <a
            href="https://extension.umd.edu/programs/environment-natural-resources/program-areas/general-forestry-course">
            General Forestry Course</a> through the University of Maryland Extension (highly recommended) and
        encountering an actual
        manual for where and how to build a brush pile to foster wildlife, we switched to accumulating our
        slash into (currently) two main brush piles on the borders of the pollinator meadow.</p>

        <p> Not surprisingly, they look very similar.
            They were created about a year apart and are added to regularly with no particular priority.
            The base is a number of larger logs and limbs stacked crosswise like a log cabin which provides
            plenty of crawl spaces and hiding for small mammals, reptiles, etc. and then large and small brush is piled
            on top creating a mostly waterproof cover. The whole gradual decay process provides habitat for all the
            creatures below mammals and birds in the food chain: bugs, worms, mushrooms, bacteria, you name it. </p>

    <h3 id="Checkdams">Check dams</h3>
    <div>
        <p>One of the significant ongoing current projects is an effort to construct check dams along the
            old logging roads created when the area was cut over about 60 years ago.

    <h3 id="Plantingtrees"> Planting trees</h3>
    <p>In the Spring of 2019, we planted 25 Redbud and 25 Black Locust in a small outcropping
        of forest we call the "42 Tree Wood", thereby making it more like a 92 tree wood.</p>

    <p>In the Spring of 2021 we planted several more species in and around the forest.</p>

    <h4>Redbud (Cercis canadensis) 2019</h4>

    <h4>Black Locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) 2019</h4>

    <h4>Sycamore (Platanus occidentalis) 2021</h4>
    <p>

        Ten seedling Sycamore trees were planted in the small floodplain along the stream.
        This area was relatively open which should provide enough sunlight for the seedlings to grow. It
        was choked with dead and broken tree debris and undergrowth including various invasives such as <a
            href="https://www.invasive.org/eastern/midatlantic/romu.html">Multiflora Rose</a> , <a
            href="https://www.invasive.org/alien/pubs/midatlantic/beth.htm">Japanese Barberry</a>, and
        <a href="https://www.invasive.org/alien/pubs/midatlantic/ceor.htm">Oriental
            Bittersweet</a>.

        <p>This is the view after clearing the area.</p>

    <div class="centeredpix">
        <p>The Sycamores are planted in 5' tree shelters. These provide an advantageous greenhouse
            atmosphere for growth in the first 3-5 years and protects them from browsing by
            White-tailed deer of which we have too many.</p>

    <h4>Sugar Maple (Acer saccharum) 2021</h4>
    <p>Six seedling Sugar Maples are planted in a small clearing just before the woods road that enters the forest.
        We call this area the "lower meadow". These augment the six Sugar Maples we planted 20 years ago as saplings
        after first moving here. We expect to harvest sap and make our own maple syrup from the original Maples
        within the next decade.
        It is likely someone else will enjoy the syrup from the six new trees.</p>
    <p>Here in the northern Maryland Piedmont, even at the 800' elevation of the farm, Sugar Maples are at or near
        the extreme southern extent of their range. It is unclear if they will survive the changes already in motion
        from global climate change.</p>
    <p>The seedling Maples are also planted in 5' tree shelters.</p>

    <div class="centeredpix">

        <p> The sapling Maples have grown well so far, even through a couple of severe July/August droughts over the
            past 20 years.
            Here is a comparison of 3 of the original ones we planted, looking at foliage color around a certain date.
