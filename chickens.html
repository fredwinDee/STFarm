    <h2>Life of Chickens</h2>
    <p>We have kept many breeds of laying chickens over the past decade or so. We typically get them as sexed
        chicks in March,
        raise them under a heat lamp in the basement for about two weeks, then transition them to a larger straw bale
        home in our
        garage with the same heat source and
        finally to the outside coop by early May when they have substantial feathers.</p>
    <p>A sexed chick simply means they
        have been determined to be male
        or female and for us, we only want to raise female chicks which are called pullets when they get feathers, and
        hens when they start laying.
        Both sexes start life simply being called "chicks". In addition to buying sexed chicks, one can also buy
        "straight run" chicks
        which means you get whatever sex was hatched and the
        hatchery does not spend the effort to "sex" them to determine if they are male or female.</p>
    <p>Straight run chicks are less expensive but if you want eggs, you can waste time and money raising roosters which
        are only good for making a lot of noise, scratching your legs to defend their hens and, of course, fertilizing
        their hens to make baby chicks.
        We only raise hens, so without roosters, we have not hatched chicks from our own fertilized eggs. To be more
        self-sufficient
        and raise your own chicks you would need a rooster. One is plenty.
    </p>
    <p>We currently have two breeds which are champion layers of brown eggs, <a

        <p>The current coop, run, and pasture.</p>
        <p> The coop was purchased from a local supplier and we added the
            enclosed run a few years later after extensive losses to Red Foxes and Red-tailed Hawks. Our first
            coop was simply an old truck cap on posts enclosed with chicken wire and a pasture within an electric-net
            fence.
            That was not adequate protection for our girls.</p>

        <p>Chicks in their initial basement home. These were Buff Orpingtons, eventually they were big, gentle, pretty
            girls but not great layers.</p>

        <p>Chicks in their garage straw bale house. If we buy the chicks a bit later than March, then we start raising
            them in the unheated
            garage under the heat lamp, skipping the early stage of keeping them in the heated basement</p>

        <p>For several years we had Black Sex Links and Ameraucanas as pictured here.
            The Black Sex Links are hybrids of a Rhode Island Red rooster with a Barred Rock hen and as such
            will not breed true if you mate them. They are a great benefit to breeders because their color is linked
            to their sex, only female chicks are all black.
            They are great layers of brown eggs and very hardy. By contrast, the Ameraucanas (AKA Easter eggers) in
            our experience lay smaller eggs and are not as productive overall. Note that chick retailers large and small
            will interchangeably label these two chicks. Ameraucanas are a breed and lay blue eggs. Easter eggers are
            not recognized
            as a breed and lay eggs of many colors so you generally find out if your chicks were not correctly labeled
            when they
            start laying. If you have children, they won't care because they will love all the pretty eggs.
            Regardless, Easter eggers have the Ameraucanas in their parentage.
