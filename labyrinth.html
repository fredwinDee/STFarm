    <h2>The Labyrinth</h2>
    <p>The labyrinth is loosely based on a greatly simplified, small scale model of the one constructed at Notre-Dame
        d'Chartres Cathedral in Chartres, France.
        It is oriented in alignment with the four primary directions, one enters from the West, facing East.
        A walking meditation takes one through the four directions several times. In the center one may place any
        small object of meaning or simply gather courage or leave one's cares.
    </p>
    <p>It is constructed with fieldstone from the property except for the three entrance pieces of bluestone from a
        salvage store in Baltimore. The outer shrub border consists of alternating
        <a href="https://plants.ces.ncsu.edu/plants/itea-virginica/">Virginia Sweetspire</a>
        and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilex_verticillata">Winterberry</a> native
        shrubs.
