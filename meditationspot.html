    <h2>Meditation Pines</h2>
    <p>Over the stream and through the woods to the opposing hillside, there is a small grove of White Pine
        with a view overlooking the stream and back from whence you came. It has some large stones for sitting, a soft
        sloped
        pine needle floor, a sweet fragrance, and a lot of peace and quiet.
        A great place to sit and think.
