    <h2>Meditation Pines</h2>
    <p>Over the stream and through the woods to the opposing hillside, there is a small grove of White Pine
        with a view overlooking the stream and back from whence you came. It has some large stones for sitting, a soft
        sloped
        pine needle floor, a sweet fragrance, and a lot of peace and quiet.
        A great place to sit and think.
    </p>
    <p>The meditation spot is on a path that meanders through the woods, sometimes following an old logging road,
        and forms a quiet walk through the woods in a loop, returning to the entry point in a small clearing where
        we have recently planted more Sugar Maples.</p>
