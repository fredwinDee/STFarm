    <h2>Pollinator Meadow</h2>
    <p>The <abbr title="Natural Resources Conservation Service">NRCS</abbr> offers an Environmental Quality Incentive
        Program (EQIP)
        that provides financial and technical assistance to encourage landowners to make changes in their land
        stewardship to improve water and air quality, enhance wildlife habitat, increase soil health, etc.
        You can read <a href="https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/main/national/programs/financial/eqip/">all
            about EQIP here.</a>

    </p>
    <p>As a non-industrial forest owner or manager with a Forest Management Plan (FMP), we are eligible to
        participate in this voluntary conservation program. It provides us with great technical advice and support
        as well as reimbursement for basic costs of materials such as trees and shrubs, cover crops, and native forbs
        and
        flower seed to establish a native wildlife habitat.</p>
    <p>We applied to the program in 2020 and were accepted. We worked with our NRCS soil conservationist to produce
        a soil conservation and water quality plan on the back 2.1 acre field (Fld 3) shown in <a
            href="index.html#thebigpicture">The Big Picture.</a> We retained total control over what we wanted to do
        and how it fit into one of the EQIP general goal descriptions, in our case a "pollinator meadow".
    </p>
    <p>Spring of 2021 we removed many invasives from the dges of the field, pushed bck the borders and planted 74 trees
        and shrubs in the border area. The dge invasives were mainly Oriental Bittersweet, an unknown Spirea, and
        In the field, there was lots of Poison Ivy, Canada Thistle, and Johnson Grass. </p>
